Description: # PyJournal
        Simple Python app for basic store management
        
        This app contains basic tools for keep sales register and stock mantainment and update.
        So far it uses sqlite for data storage, further versions may include MySql if demanded
        
        The UI was made using PySide2
        
        The app language is Spanish, but further versions may include other languages support
        
        The final goal is to get a working app for handle small stores, and maybe including web capabilites for scaling
